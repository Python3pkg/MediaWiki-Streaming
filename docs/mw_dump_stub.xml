'English' Cemetery, Florence
The land for this cemetery in Piazzale Donatello in Florence was bought by the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church from the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1827 and was in use for fity years, until 1877, when the medieval wall had been torn down and it became within the city limits. The majority of the burials are English, but also Swiss, Russian, American and many other nationalities. The tomb stones are in many scripts and languages. The most famous burials are those of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in a tomb by Lord Leighton, Walter Savage Landor, Fanny and Theodosia Trollope, Arthur Hugh Clough, Isa Blagden, Southwood Smith, Hiram Powers, Joel Hart, these last two sculptors, and Nadezhda De Santis who came to Florence at 14, a black Nubian slave brought by Champollion and Rossellini's expedition to Egypt and Nubia, who was baptized with the name meaning Hope by her Russian family. Holman Hunt sculpted the tomb of his wife Fanny here, and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope that of his daughter. Arnold Boecklin, the Swiss painter, buried his baby daughter Maria here.
A complete catalogue of the burials is online at http://www.florin.ms/cemetery1.html, etc. Visiting hours are 9-12 Monday mornings, 3-6 summers, 2-5 winters, Tuesday through Friday afternoons. The Gatehouse has a library with books by and about the persons buried here.</text>

'English' Cemetery, Florence
The land for this cemetery in Piazzale Donatello in Florence was bought by the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church from the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1827 and was in use for fifty years, until 1877, when the medieval wall had been torn down and it became within the city limits. The majority of the burials, beneath its tall cypresses on a small hill, are English, but also Swiss, Russian, American and many other nationalities. The tomb stones are in many scripts and languages. The most famous burials are those of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] (1806-1861), in a tomb by [[Lord Leighton]] (1830-1898), [[Walter Savage Landor]] (1775-1864), [[Fanny Trollope]] (1780-1863) and Theodosia Trollope, [[Arthur Hugh Clough]] (1819-1861), Isa Blagden, Southwood Smith, [[Hiram Powers]] (1805-1873), Joel Hart, these last two sculptors, and Nadezhda De Santis who came to Florence at 14, a black Nubian slave brought by [[Jean François Champollion]] (1790-1832) and Ipolito Rossellini's expedition to Egypt and Nubia, funded by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was baptized with the name meaning 'Hope' by her Russian family. [[William Holman Hunt]] sculpted the tomb of his wife Fanny buried here, and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope that of his daughter. [[Arnold Boecklin]] (1827-1901), the Swiss painter, buried his baby daughter Maria here, inspiring his several canvases of [['The Island of the Dead']]. A complete catalogue of the burials is online at http://www.florin.ms/cemetery1.html, etc. Visiting hours are 9:00-12:00 Monday mornings, 3:00-6:00 summers, 2:00-5:00 winters, Tuesday through Friday afternoons. The Gatehouse has a library with books by and about the persons buried here.

[[Image:http://www.florin.ms/ebbtomb.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Tomb Designed by Lord Leighton]]
The land for this cemetery in Piazzale Donatello in Florence was bought by the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church from the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1827 and was in use for fifty years, until 1877, when the medieval wall had been torn down and it became within the city limits. The majority of the burials, beneath its tall cypresses on a small hill, are English, but also Swiss, Russian, American and many other nationalities. The tomb stones are in many scripts and languages. The most famous burials are those of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] (1806-1861), in a tomb by [[Lord Leighton]] (1830-1898), [[Walter Savage Landor]] (1775-1864), [[Fanny Trollope]] (1780-1863) and [[Theodosia Trollope]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]] (1819-1861), [[Isa Blagden]], [[Southwood Smith]], [[Theodore Parker]] (1810-1860), [[Richard Hildreth]] (1807-1865), [[Hiram Powers]] (1805-1873), [[Joel Hart]], these last two sculptors, and Nadezhda De Santis who came to Florence at 14, a black Nubian slave brought by [[Jean-François Champollion]] (1790-1832) and [[Ippolito Rosellini]](1800-1843)'s 1828 expedition to Egypt and Nubia, funded by the [[Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany]], she being baptized with the name meaning 'Hope' by her Russian family. [[William Holman Hunt]] (1827-1910) sculpted the tomb of his wife Fanny buried here, and [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]] that of his daughter. [[Arnold Boecklin]] (1827-1901), the Swiss painter, buried his baby daughter Maria here, inspiring his several canvases of 'The Island of the Dead'. [[Mary Somerville]], who taught Ada Lovelace, [[Lord Byron]]'s daughter, mathematics, buried her husband William here, [[Ada Lovelace]] then working with [[Charles Babbage]] to invent the computing machine using Jacquard loom cards. A complete catalogue of the burials is online at http://www.florin.ms/cemetery1.html, etc. Visiting hours are 9:00-12:00 Monday mornings, 3:00-6:00 summers, 2:00-5:00 winters, Tuesday through Friday afternoons. The Gatehouse has a library with books by and about the persons buried here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Nagamaki-Naomi is a version of the Japanese Naginata in which the staff of the weapon was only between 3 and 5 feet long and the blade was usually of full katana length (between 3-1/2 and 4-1/2 feet), as opposed to the standard Naginata, which was constructed with a 6 foot staff and a blade of about 2-1/2 feet. The blades of both were built the same as the katana, and as such were folded steel and iron with differential tempering using a firing clay that created a soft core and hard edge, and they were swept from the handle to aid in slashing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''International Federation of PGA Tours''' is the trade body for the six leading regional men's professional golf tours. As at 2004, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money}
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Africa ((mainly South Africa))

These six tournaments co-sanction the [[World Golf Rankings]].

==Other Men's Professional Tours==

*[[World Golf Ranking]] points are avaiable on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA European Tour]]
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA Tour]]

There are several other men's professional tours in the World, the most prominent of which is the [[Latin American Tour]] which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status.

==Women's Tours==

Women's professional [[golf]] is organised by independent tours. The two principal ones are:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]]

==Senior Tours==

Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so these events, unless they are unable to for health reasons. The two main tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Professional [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative professional sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite with the profession.  

==Structure of tour golf==

Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, which stage a sequence of weekly tournaments. The larger tours provide a tournament almost every week for a season that lasts for most of the year. Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the Millenium. 

With the partial exceptions of the [[Ladies European Tour]] and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], all of the other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them will move to a higher ranked tour as soon he or she can. 

==International Federation of PGA Tours==

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2004, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[World Golf Rankings]]. 

==Other Men's Professional Tours==

Official World Golf Ranking points are also available in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA European Tour]])
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA Tour]])

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to, others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The next most important regional tour is the [[Latin American Tour]] which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].
 
==Men's senior tours==

Male golfers over the age of fifty are eligible to compete in senior touraments. [[Golf]] is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the Millenium. 

With the partial exceptions of the [[Ladies European Tour]] and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], all of the other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them will move to a higher ranked tour as soon he or she can. 

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2004, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[World Golf Rankings]]. 

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also available in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA European Tour]])
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA Tour]])

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to, others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The next most important regional tour is the [[Latin American Tour]] which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].
 
===Men's senior tours===

Male golfers over the age of fifty are eligible to compete in senior touraments. [[Golf]] is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group.

Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, leaving aside Tiger Woods. The two main tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's Tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also available in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA European Tour]])
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA Tour]])

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to, others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The next most important regional tour is the [[Latin American Tour]] which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].
 
===Men's senior tours===

Male golfers over the age of fifty are eligible to compete in senior touraments. [[Golf]] is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, leaving aside Tiger Woods. The two main tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's Tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Professional [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative professional sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven and even eight figure incomes. [[Tiger Woods]] is one of the two highest earning sportsmen in the world according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in, and after costs are taken into account, lesser known tournament golfers who do not have a steady income from endorsements, can make a large loss in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==

Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, which stage a sequence of weekly tournaments. The larger tours provide a tournament almost every week for a season that lasts for most of the year. Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the Millenium. 

With the partial exceptions of the [[Ladies European Tour]] and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], all of the other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them will move to a higher ranked tour as soon he or she can.

==Structure of tour golf==

Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, which stage a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] or an independent tour organisation, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during a season that lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member.

*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the Millenium. 

With the partial exceptions of the [[Ladies European Tour]] and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], all of the other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them will move to a higher ranked tour as soon he or she can. 

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA European Tour]])
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA Tour]])

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The next most important regional tour is the [[Tour de las Americas]] which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].

===Men's senior tours===

Male golfers over the age of fifty are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. [[Golf]] is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, leaving aside Tiger Woods. The two main tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's Tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Professional [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative professional sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven and even eight figure incomes. [[Tiger Woods]] is one of the two highest earning sportsmen in the world according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in, and after costs are taken into account, lesser known tournament golfers who do not have a steady income from endorsements, can make a large loss in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==

Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, which stage a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] or an independent tour organisation, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during a season that lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Professional golf==
Professional [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative professional sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven and even eight figure U.S. Dollar incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is one of the two highest earning sportsmen in the world according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses as well as paying for a [[caddy]].  Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated.  Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all.  Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser known tournament golfers who are playing erratically and do not have a steady income from endorsements, can make a large loss in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, which stage a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] or an independent tour organisation, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during a season that lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

With the partial exceptions of the [[Ladies European Tour]] and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], all of the other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them will move to a higher ranked tour as soon he or she can.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA European Tour]])
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the [[PGA Tour]])

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The next most important regional tour is the [[Tour de las Americas]] which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].

===Men's senior tours===

Male golfers over the age of fifty are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].

===Men's senior tours===

Male golfers over the age of fifty are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Professional [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative professional sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven and even eight figure U.S. Dollar incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is one of the two highest earning sportsmen in the world according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses as well as paying for a [[caddy]].  Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated.  Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all.  Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser known tournament golfers who are playing erratically and do not have a steady income from endorsements, can make a large loss in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] or an independent tour organisation, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during a season that lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

With the partial exceptions of the [[Ladies European Tour]] and the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], all of the other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them will move to a higher ranked tour as soon he or she can.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Professional [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven and even eight figure U.S. Dollar incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses as well as paying for a [[caddy]].  Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated.  Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all.  Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser known tournament golfers who are playing erratically and do not have a steady income from endorsements, can make a large loss in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organised into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] or an independent tour organisation, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during a season that lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot;; or by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or much more rarely, by having notable achievements on other tours which make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the PGA Senior Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot; (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]], and there is a similar tour based in the United Kingdom called the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven- and even eight-figure [[U.S. Dollar]] incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world, according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during the season, which lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish.

The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can. However some golfers play on more than one tour.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[PGA European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. The third tier tour in the United States is the [[NGA Hooters Tour]], and there is a similar tour based in the United Kingdom called the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]].

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

      <comment>/* Structure of tour golf */ some golfers play on more than one tour</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot; or &quot;Pro golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven- and even eight-figure [[U.S. Dollar]] incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world, according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during the season, which lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot; (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[PGA European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates.

These are the [[NGA Hooters Tour]] and the [[Grey Goose Tour]] in the United States, and the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]], the [[Alps Tour]] and the [[EPD Tour]], each of which is based in a different part of Europe. At this level players the prize money is partly funded by player entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on getting on to a higher tour. Below the third level tours there are local &quot;mini-tours&quot;; at this level there is no possibility of earning a living from the prize money and players compete purely to gain competitive experience.

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot; or &quot;Pro golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven- and even eight-figure [[U.S. Dollar]] incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world, according to [[Forbes Magazine]]. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during the season, which lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot; (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can, but may continue to play on his or her home tour a few times a year.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[European Tour]] (ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. 

The United States and Europe also have third level tours for players who haven't made it onto the Nationwide Tour or the Challenge Tour. These are the [[NGA Hooters Tour]] and the [[Grey Goose Tour]] in the United States, and the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]], the [[Alps Tour]] and the [[EPD Tour]], each of which is based in a different part of Europe. At this level the prize money is partly funded by entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on moving up to a higher tour. 

Below the third level tours there are local &quot;mini-tours&quot;. At this level there is no possibility of earning a living from the prize money and players compete purely to gain competitive experience. Some are employed as club or teaching professionals and play tournaments part time, some may have sponsors or family backing. There have also been some well known sportsmen from other sports who after retiring as wealthy men while still at an age when elite golfers are in their prime, have tried their luck as tournament golfers, but none of them have made it into golf's elite so far. Examples include [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Roy Wegerle]].

===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[European Tour]] (also visits Africa, Asia and Australasia; ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other Men's Professional Tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. In 2005 the China Golf Association launched the [[China Golf Tour]].

The United States and Europe also have third level tours for players who haven't made it onto the Nationwide Tour or the Challenge Tour. These are the [[NGA Hooters Tour]] and the [[Grey Goose Tour]] in the United States, and the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]], the [[Alps Tour]] and the [[EPD Tour]], each of which is based in a different part of Europe. At this level the prize money is partly funded by entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on moving up to a higher tour. 

Below the third level tours there are local &quot;mini-tours&quot;. At this level there is no possibility of earning a living from the prize money and players compete purely to gain competitive experience. Some are employed as club or teaching professionals and play tournaments part time, some may have sponsors or family backing. There have also been some well known sportsmen from other sports who after retiring as wealthy men while still at an age when elite golfers are in their prime, have tried their luck as tournament golfers, but none of them have made it into golf's elite so far. Examples include [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Roy Wegerle]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]]. Sweden, which is the European country where women's golf is most popular, has its own [[Telia Tour]], which serves as a feeder tour for the Ladies European Tour.

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot; or &quot;Pro golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven- and even eight-figure [[U.S. Dollar]] incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world, according to ''[[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]]'' magazine. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during the season, which lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a &quot;Qualifying School&quot; (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can, but may continue to play on his or her home tour a few times a year.

It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during the season, which lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a [[Qualifying School]] (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can, but may continue to play on his or her home tour a few times a year.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[European Tour]] (also visits Africa, Asia and Australasia; ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other men's tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The official development tour in Japan is the [[Japan Challenge Tour]]. Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. In 2005 the China Golf Association launched the [[China Golf Tour]].

The United States and Europe also have third level tours for players who haven't made it onto the Nationwide Tour or the Challenge Tour. These are the [[NGA Hooters Tour]] and the [[Grey Goose Gateway Tour]] in the United States, and the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]], the [[Alps Tour]] and the [[EPD Tour]], each of which is based in a different part of Europe. At this level the prize money is partly funded by entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on moving up to a higher tour. 

Below the third level tours there are local &quot;mini-tours&quot;. At this level there is no possibility of earning a living from the prize money and players compete purely to gain competitive experience. Some are employed as club or teaching professionals and play tournaments part time, some may have sponsors or family backing. There have also been some well known sportsmen from other sports who after retiring as wealthy men while still at an age when elite golfers are in their prime, have tried their luck as tournament golfers, but none of them have made it into golf's elite so far. Examples include [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Roy Wegerle]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]]. Sweden, which is the European country where women's golf is most popular, has its own [[Telia Tour]], which serves as a feeder tour for the Ladies European Tour.

A senior tour for women was founded in 2001:

*[[Women's Senior Golf Tour]]

[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot; or &quot;Pro golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession.

The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]]. Sweden, which is the European country where women's golf is most popular, has its own [[Telia Tour]], which serves as a feeder tour for the Ladies European Tour.

In 2001 the U.S. based ''Women's Senior Golf Tour'' was founded. In 2006 it was rebranded as the [[Legends Tour]].

[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot; or &quot;Pro golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven- and even eight-figure [[U.S. Dollar]] incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world, according to ''[[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]]'' magazine. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week during the season, which lasts for most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a [[Qualifying School]] (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium. 

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can, but may continue to play on his or her home tour a few times a year.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[European Tour]] (also visits Africa, Asia and Australasia; ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other men's tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The official development tour in Japan is the [[Japan Challenge Tour]]. Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. In 2005 the China Golf Association launched the [[China Golf Tour]].

The United States and Europe also have third level tours for players who haven't made it onto the Nationwide Tour or the Challenge Tour. These are the [[NGA Hooters Tour]] and the [[Grey Goose Gateway Tour]] in the United States, and the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]], the [[Alps Tour]] and the [[EPD Tour]], each of which is based in a different part of Europe. At this level the prize money is partly funded by entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on moving up to a higher tour. 

Below the third level tours there are local &quot;mini-tours&quot;. At this level there is no possibility of earning a living from the prize money and players compete purely to gain competitive experience. Some are employed as club or teaching professionals and play tournaments part time, some may have sponsors or family backing. There have also been some well known sportsmen from other sports who, after retiring as wealthy men while still at an age when elite golfers are in their prime, have tried their luck as tournament golfers on the developmental tours, but none of them have made it into golf's elite so far. Examples include [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Roy Wegerle]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]]. Sweden, which is the European country where women's golf is most popular, has its own [[Telia Tour]], which serves as a feeder tour for the Ladies European Tour.

In 2001 the U.S. based ''Women's Senior Golf Tour'' was founded. In 2006 it was rebranded as the [[Legends Tour]].

The other tours are effectively &quot;feeder&quot; tours: any player who succeeds on them is likely to move to a richer tour as soon he or she can, but may continue to play on his or her home tour a few times a year.

==Men's tours==
===International Federation of PGA Tours===

The International Federation of PGA Tours is the trade body of the main men's professional golf tours. As at 2005, there are six members:

*[[Asian Tour]] (for Asia excluding Japan)
*[[Japan Golf Tour]] (ranks third by prize money)
*[[European Tour]] (also visits Africa, Asia and Australasia; ranks second by prize money)
*[[PGA TOUR]] (based in the United States; ranks first by prize money)
*[[PGA Tour of Australasia]]
*[[Sunshine Tour]] (Southern Africa - mainly South Africa)

These six tours co-sanction the [[Official World Golf Rankings]].

===Other men's tours===

Official World Golf Ranking points are also awarded for good placings in events on three other tours:

*[[Canadian Tour]]
*[[Challenge Tour]] (second-tier tour to the European Tour)
*[[Nationwide Tour]] (second-tier tour to the PGA Tour)

Below this level, the tours do not offer ranking points, and the prize money on offer will be at a level that allows only a few of the members, or perhaps none of them at all, to make their main income from playing on that tour alone. Some of the players will also play on other tours when they are able to and others will be club or teaching professionals who play tournament golf part time. 

The official development tour in Japan is the [[Japan Challenge Tour]]. Other regional tours include the [[Tour de las Americas]], which aspires to gain [[World Golf Ranking|world ranking points]] status in the near future, and the [[Indian Golf Tour]]. In 2005 the China Golf Association launched the [[China Golf Tour]].

The United States and Europe also have third level tours for players who haven't made it onto the Nationwide Tour or the Challenge Tour. These are the [[NGA Hooters Tour]] and the [[Grey Goose Gateway Tour]] in the United States, and the [[PGA EuroPro Tour]], the [[Alps Tour]] and the [[EPD Tour]], each of which is based in a different part of Europe. At this level the prize money is partly funded by entrance fees and only the most successful players will win enough to do more than cover their expenses: the emphasis is very much on moving up to a higher tour. 

Below the third level tours there are local &quot;mini-tours&quot;. At this level there is no possibility of earning a living from the prize money and players compete purely to gain competitive experience. Some are employed as club or teaching professionals and play tournaments part time, some may have sponsors or family backing. There have also been some well known sportsmen from other sports who, after retiring as wealthy men while still at an age when elite golfers are in their prime, have tried their luck as tournament golfers on the developmental tours, but none of them have made it into golf's elite so far. Examples include [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Roy Wegerle]].

===Men's senior tours===
Upon reaching age 50, male golfers are eligible to compete in senior tournaments. Golf is unique among [[sports]] in having high profile and lucrative competitions for players of this age group. Nearly all of the famous golfers who are eligible to compete in these events choose to do so, unless they are unable to for health reasons. A number of players win more than a million dollars in prize money each season, and once endorsements and other business activities are taken into account, a few of the &quot;legends of golf&quot; in this age group earn more or less as much as any of the younger PGA Tour pros, other than [[Tiger Woods]]. The two main senior tours are:

*[[Champions Tour]] (based in the [[United States]]}
*[[European Seniors Tour]]

==Women's tours==

Women's professional golf is also organised by independent regional tours. Leading women golfers make incomes well into seven figures, meaning that they are beaten in this regards by few other sportswomen apart from top [[tennis]] players. The women's tours include:

*[[LPGA Tour]] (based in the [[United States]])
*[[Ladies European Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Japan Tour]]
*[[LPGA of Korea Tour]]
*[[ALPG Tour]] (based in [[Australia]])

The second tier women's professional tour in the [[United States]] is called the [[Futures Tour]]. Sweden, which is the European country where women's golf is most popular, has its own [[Telia Tour]], which serves as a feeder tour for the Ladies European Tour.

In 2001 the U.S. based ''Women's Senior Golf Tour'' was founded. In 2006 it was rebranded as the [[Legends Tour]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
[[Professional golfer|Professional]] [[golf]] is one of the more lucrative sports in the world for both men and women, but it is has a very different structure from other sports, especially team sports. A large majority of professional golfers (at least 95%) make their main income as club or teaching professionals, rather than from competition. &quot;Touring professionals&quot;, also known as &quot;Tournament golfers&quot; or &quot;Pro golfers&quot;, who make their income from prize money and endorsements, are a small elite within the profession. The very best golfers make seven- and even eight-figure [[U.S. Dollar]] incomes; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest earning sportsman in the world, according to ''[[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]]'' magazine. 

But for the less successful, tournament golf can be an unstable profession. It is also an expensive one to participate in: tournaments have entry fees and practical costs such as travel and lodging expenses, as well as paying for a [[caddy]]. Moreover, most tournaments have a &quot;cut&quot; midway through, in which the bottom half of players with the worst scores are eliminated. Only those players remaining after the cut earn any prize money at all. Thus, after costs are taken into account, lesser-known tournament golfers who are playing erratically (and do not have a steady income from endorsements) can be in dire financial straits in a bad year.

==Structure of tour golf==
Professional golf is organized into a number of regional &quot;tours&quot;, each of which stages a sequence of weekly tournaments. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[PGA]] (or an independent tour organisation) which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Most of the major tours are player controlled organisations whose commercial objective is to maximise the income of their members by maximising prize money. The larger tours have a tournament almost every week through most of the year. 

Each tour has &quot;members&quot; who have earned their &quot;tour cards&quot;, meaning they are entitled to play in as many of its events as they wish. A golfer can become a member of a leading tour by succeeding in an entry tournament, usually called a [[Qualifying School]] (&quot;Q-School&quot;); or, by achieving a designated level of success in its tournaments when competing as an invited non-member; or, much rarer, by having enough notable achievements on other tours to make them a desirable member. Membership of some of the lesser tours is open to any registered professional who pays an entry fee.

There are enormous differences in the financial awards offered by the various golf tours, so players on one of the lesser tours always aspire to move up if they can. The [[PGA Tour]], which is the first-tier tour in the United States, offers nearly a hundred times as much prize money each season as the third-tier [[NGA Hooters Tour]]. The hierarchy of tours in financial terms is as follows:

*Clear 1st: [[PGA Tour]]
*Clear 2nd: [[European Tour]]
*Others in the top 5 (in alphabetical order): [[Champions Tour]]; [[Japan Golf Tour]]; [[LPGA Tour]].

The last three have probably shuffled in the rankings, and this depends partly on exchange rates. The Japan Golf Tour was at its relative peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] was also at its peak, the Champions Tour (then the Senior PGA Tour) reached a relative peak in the mid to late 1990s, and the LPGA Tour seems to have strengthened its relative position slightly since the turn of the millennium.
